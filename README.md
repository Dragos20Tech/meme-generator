# React Meme Generator

I built my first interactive web app in React through [Bob Ziroll's course on Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/playlist/prXJpCQ). This project introduced me to several new concepts, including event listeners, ***state handling***, useState array destructuring, ***data passing between components***, dynamic styling, ***derived state versus lifted state***, forms, controlled components, ***making API calls***, ***handling side effects with useEffect***, and the useEffect cleanup function.
